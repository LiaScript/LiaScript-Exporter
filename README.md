# LiaScript-Exporter

This shall be a generic LiaScript-Exporter that can export educational content
into different formats, so that LiaScript courses can also be utilized in
different Learning Management Systems (LMS) or Readers for static content (PDF,
ePub, ...). At the moment there is only support for SCORM1.2, as the most
wide-spread exchange format. See the last section
[LMS Support List](#LMS-Support-List)

> __But__, it is still the easiest way to share your courses via
> __`https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?YOUR_REPO`__. The LiaScript course
> website is a fully fledged "offline-first" Progressive Web App (PWA), which
> allows to store all of your courses and states directly within your browser. If
> you are comming from Android, you can also directly install the website as an
> app on your device. Actually, there is now need for a BackEnd-system anymore,
> but if you need to track the progress of you students, you can use this tool...

## Install

At the moment this is a simple command-line tool based on NodeJS, thus you will
have to install NodeJS first, which contains also `npm` the Node Package
Manager. You can directly download the installer for your system from:

<https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

Afterwards you can open your terminal and type in the following command, this
will install the LiaScript-Exporter as a global application on your system.

__Install from npm:__

``` bash
npm install -g --verbose @liascript/exporter
```

Depending on your configuration, you might need to run this command with root
privileges. In my case on Linux it is simply:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g --verbose @liascript/exporter
```

Depending on your configuration, you might need to run this command with root
privileges. In my case on Linux it is simply:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g --verbose https://github.com/liaScript/LiaScript-Exporter
```

On Windows you might need to run the terminal with administrator-privileges.

## Basic CLI usage

If you have installed the package, you can now use `liaex` or
`liascript-exporter`. If you type one of the following commands, you will get
the following output.

``` shell
$ liaex
No input defined
LiaScript-Exporter

Export your LiaScript Markdown files to different formats. The following
commandline options are available. Based on the selected output format,
additional options can be used.

-h --help                   show this help
-i --input                  file to be used as input
-p --path                   path to be packed, if not set, the path of the input
                            file is used
-o --output                 output file name (default is output), the ending is
                            define by the format
-s --style                  additional styling to passed to the export, can be
                            used for fixes, such as "height: 100vh; width: 100%;
                            border: 2px;"
-f --format                 scorm1.2, scorm2004, json, fullJson, web, ims, pdf,
                            android, linkedData (default is json)
-v --version                output the current version
-k --key                    responsive voice key

### SCORM1.2

If you want to generate a SCORM1.2 conformant package of you LiaScript-course,
use the following command:

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format scorm1.2 --output rockOn

..
project/README.md
project/Lizenz.md
..
[17:8:33] SCORM 'Init'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/imsmanifest.xml'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/metadata.xml'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/adlcp_rootv1p2.xsd'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/ims_xml.xsd'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/imscp_rootv1p1p2.xsd'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'create /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro/imsmd_rootv1p2p1.xsd'
[17:8:33] SCORM 'Archiving /tmp/lia202037-30349-o6yx80.zb0eo/pro to rockOn.zip'
[17:8:34] SCORM 'rockOn.zip 4977779 total bytes'
Done

$ ls
.. rockOn.zip ..
```

The format is `scorm1.2` and the input folder is `project/README.md`. All the
content and sub-folders of this folder is then copied into your SCORM.zip. The
name is defined by your output definition and contains the current version
number of you course as well as the current date.

> Note: SCORM 1.2 is too restrictive for storing data, that is why we currently
> only support to store location information, all states of quizzes, surveys, etc.
> will be lost after reload.
>
> Better use __SCORM2004__ as output

__Text 2 Speech `--key`__

If you want to use text2speech, you will have to register your website (where
the scorm package will be served) at <https://responsivevoice.org/> ... it is free
for educational and non commercial purposes. After your registration, you will
get a key in the format of `KluQksUs`. To inject this key into your package,
simply add the key as a parameter:

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format scorm1.2 --key KluQksUs --output rockOn
...
```

__Mastery Score `--scorm-masteryScore`__

You can define the percentage of quizzes and surveys a student had to fullfil
in order to accomplish or pass the course by adding the `--scorm-masteryScore`
parameter. Just set it to 0 to allow all to pass the course, otherwise choose a
value between 0 and 100. All quizzes and surveys are treated equally, thus if
your course contains 10 quizzes, every quiz counts as 10%. If you do not set
this parameter, a default value of 80 percent is used.

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format scorm1.2 --scorm-masteryScore 0 --output rockOn
...
```

__Other Root `--path`__

If your README is not in the root of your project, you can also use the `--path`
parameter to the directory to be copied into your scorm project. You will still
have to use `--input` to define the main course document, but his has to be
relative to path parameter.

__`--scrom-organization`__

This parameter simply sets the organization parameter in your SCORM
`imsmanifest` file. All other parameters are taken from the course

__`--scorm-iframe`__

Some LMS like ILIAS or OpenOlat seem to have problems with the required
`startingParameter` and will not load SCORM1.2 courses properly. To fix this,
this parameter can be used. It tries to run the course within an additional
`<iframe>`.

### SCORM2004

This output format provides the same settings as `scorm1.2`, but it allows to
store state information within the backend LMS. Currently supported are the
states for:

* quizzes
* surveys
* tasks

coding elements currently exceed the max storage capacity, that is why these
are not stored at the moment.

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format scorm2004 --output rockOn

### IMS Content

IMS Content is a very simplistic packaging format. Which allows you to embed
your course different LMS. The standard for the packaging format is defined
[here](https://www.imsglobal.org/content/packaging/index.html).

We currently support the latest v1.1.4 standard.

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format ims --output course
..
project/README.md
project/Lizenz.md
..
6041733 total bytes
archiver has been finalized and the output file descriptor has closed.

$ ls
.. course.zip ..
```

__`--ims-indexeddb`:__ By default no states are preserved, which means, if you
reload the course, all quiz and coding states are destroyed. By using this
option a course is generated, which stores the content within the browsers local
`indexeddb`.

``` shell
$ liaex -i project/README.md --format ims --output course --ims-indexeddb
..
project/README.md
project/Lizenz.md
..Project settings:

--project-no-meta          Disable the generation of meta information for OpenGraph and Twitter-cards.
--project-no-categories    Disable the filter for categories/tags.
--project-category-blur    Enable this and the categories will be blurred instead of deleted.
--project-generate-pdf     PDFs are automatically generated and added to every card.
6041733 total bytes
archiver has been finalized and the output file descriptor has closed.

$ ls
.. course.zip ..
```

### WEB

This format will generate an autonomous & standalone web-project that can be uploaded
to any webserver.

```
$ liaex --format web -i project/README.md -o outputFolder
updating title ...
updating description ...
updating logo ...
```

All required sources as well as your project are copied into the `outputFolder` and
your course-file will be used as the default course. If you have defined the macros
`comment` and `logo` within your course, these information will also be injected into
the index.html. Such that, if you share your project via facebook or twitter, this
information is used to generate preview cards properly.

If you want your site to speak the text out loud, then you will have to add your
responsivevoice-key via `--key`.

__`--web-zip`:__ Use this parameter to directly bundle all input into a zip
file instead of a folder.

__`--web-iframe`:__ This will put the course into an secondary iframe, which will
hide the course-URL (the Markdown-file). Unfortunately, it will not be possible
anymore to link from outside to a specific slide.

__`web-indexeddb`:__ Generate a LiaScript package that will store states persistently.
By default, the database is generated uniquely for the packed course. That means,
every update will use a new database, which makes sense, if and only if, typos get
corrected or content is added to the end of the document. Mixing content and moving
quizzes and surveys to different slides might cause some problems in restoring the
state. But you can use this parameter with a key:

```shell
liaex --format web -i project/README.md -o outputFolder --web-indexeddb someKeyToUse
updating title ...
updating description ...
updating logo ...
```

### Android

To generate an APK project of your course, you will have to download the
[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) at first and provide the path
via the option `--android-sdk`. Additionally you will have to define an `appId`
via `--android-appId`, which is in most cases an unique URL (in reverse order)
that is pointing to your website/project. This export uses
[capacitorjs](https://capacitorjs.com) to pack the entire LiaScript runtime
environment and your resources into one installable Android apk.

``` shell
$ liaex -f android \
  -i ../LiaBooks/Arbeitsbuch-Prolog/README.md \
  --android-sdk /home/andre/Android/Sdk \
  --android-appId io.github.liascript.arbeitsbuch-prolog

__Still a bit experimental__

### PDF

For printing out courses to PDF this package uses
[puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagepdfoptions),
which is an entire browser. This blows up the project a bit, but it allows to
store also the results of iframes, and to run coding examples. What this export
does is basically load the entire course within a single page and run all
scripts included, code examples, etc. Videos, iframes, audio, etc. are preserved
as screenshots, which provide a link to the original resource.

This format has a `--pdf-preview` mode, which allows you to inspect your course,
which works also with https inputs.

``` shell
liaex --format pdf --pdf-preview -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/VL_Softwareentwicklung/master/00_Einfuehrung.md

```

There are a couple of tweaks, that you can use, have a look at the following
resource:

[Puppeteer pdf settings](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#pagepdfoptions)

__`--pdf-stylesheet`__

Next to these settings, you can also change the appearance of fonts, colors, etc.
with you custom CSS. This can define anything, and you can also overwrite all CSS
variables LiaScript is based on.

``` bash
$ cat custom.css \
:root {
    --color-highlight: 2, 255, 0;
    --color-background: 122, 122, 122;
    --color-border: 0, 0, 0;
    --color-highlight-dark: 0, 0, 0;
    --color-highlight-menu: 0, 0, 0;
    --color-text: 0, 0, 255;
    --global-font-size: 1rem;
    --font-size-multiplier: 2;
}% 
$
$ liaex --format pdf \
  -o example \
  --pdf-stylesheet custom.css \
  -i https://github.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/VL_ProzeduraleProgrammierung/blob/master/08_Objekte.md

depending on the size of the course, this can take a while, please be patient...
```

__`--pdf-theme`__

If you want to change only the appearance by defining the LiaScript theme,
which can be either: default, turquoise, blue, red, yellow.

``` bash
$ liaex --format pdf \
  -o example \
  --pdf-theme red \
  -i https://github.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/VL_ProzeduraleProgrammierung/blob/master/08_Objekte.md

depending on the size of the course, this can take a while, please be patient...
```

__`--pdf-timeout`__

You have to be aware, that the PDF generation can be quite time consuming
especially for large courses with a lot of scripts and code-snippets to be
executed and multimedia to be loaded. `puppeteer` thus sometimes does not know
when the course is ready. If the generation fails, you should try to increase
this value, the default is 30000, which means 30 seconds.

``` bash
$ liaex --format pdf \
  -o example \
  --pdf-timeout 50000 \
  -i https://github.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/VL_ProzeduraleProgrammierung/blob/master/08_Objekte.md

depending on the size of the course, this can take a while, please be patient...
```

### Project

Projects are a way to bundle a collection of courses and to make a custom overview page for it.

The input has to be a yaml file that looks like the following one:

```yml
title: >
  <span style="background-color: rgba(0,106,179,0.75); padding: 5px; color: white">
    My personal OER - collection
  </span>

comment: >
  This is used as a subtitle or as a description of your page

icon: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Logo_TU_Bergakademie_Freiberg.svg/242px-Logo_TU_Bergakademie_Freiberg.svg.png

footer: >
  Simply add a custom footer - that can also contain HTML
  <a href="https://liascript.github.io" target="_blank">Made with LiaScript</a>

# With this settings you can customize social metadata, og-graph for facebook or twitter
# if not present, the title, comment, and logo will be used.

    # 
    # For smaller overviews, you can also use the --project-category-blur parameter.
    # this will not hide the courses, that do not match, but instead blur them.

      <p>You can add additional content in between to group your course collections or provide more information.</p>

  # If you want to group multiple courses into one sub-collection, then instead of an "-url:"
  # define another `collection`. All parameters can be changed as above. Additionally you can switch of images or comments,
  # just by adding an empty attribute. And, it is also possible to add tags to every sub-course.

        arguments:
          - pdf-format: A3
          - project-generate-scorm2004: true
          - scorm-organization: TU-Bergakademie Freiberg

      - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUBAF-IfI-LiaScript/VL_Softwareentwicklung/master/27_Anwendungen.md
        arguments:
          - project-generate-pdf: false
```

Basic usage:

``` shell
liaex -i curriculum.yml --format project
```

If you want to add precompiled pdf to every course, then you simply have to add the `--project-generate-pdf` command.
Additionally, you can pass any pdf settings to customize the pdf output.


``` shell
liaex -i curriculum.yml --format project --project-generate-pdf --pdf-format A4
```

As it is depicted in the last part of the yaml file above, you can manually set or change all parameters.
Such as, for which projects you want to generate a pdf and pass also all additional parameters.
Simply pass all arguments as `arguments` with the long name and without the starting dashes.
This way you can generate a very detailed project configuration and overview.


### RDF & JSON-LD

The LiaScript metainformation can be exported to RDF, either as json-ld or as n-quads. The option `--pdf-preview` generates a console output that can be used to inspect the result. Otherwise the result is stored in a file, defined by `-o`, the file-ending is either `.jsonld` or `.np`, depending on the `--rdf-format`

``` shell
liaex --format rdf --rdf-preview -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md",
  "@type": "Course",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "email": "LiaScript@web.de",
    "name": "André Dietrich"
  },
  "description": "This document shall provide an entire compendium and course on the development of Open-courSes with [LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io). As the language and the systems grows, also this document will be updated. Feel free to fork or copy it, translations are very welcome...",
  "image": {
    "@type": "ImageObject",
    "url": "https://liascript.github.io/img/bg-showcase-1.jpg"
  },
  "inLanguage": "en",
  "name": "LiaScript",
  "url": "https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md",
  "version": "22.0.2"
}
```

The result as n-quads looks like this:

``` shell
liaex --format rdf --rdf-preview --rdf-format n-quads -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md> <http://schema.org/author> _:b0 .

```

If you are working on a local repository and you want to add the remote URL, you can specify `--rdf-url` and run it with a local file as input:

``` shell
liaex --format rdf --rdf-preview -i ../LiaBooks/docs/README.md --rdf-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@id": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md",
  "@type": "Course",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "email": "LiaScript@web.de",
    "name": "André Dietrich"
  },
  "description": "This document shall provide an entire compendium and course on the development of Open-courSes with [LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io). As the language and the systems grows, also this document will be updated. Feel free to fork or copy it, translations are very welcome...",
  "image": {
    "@type": "ImageObject",
    "url": "https://liascript.github.io/img/bg-showcase-1.jpg"
  },
  "inLanguage": "en",
  "name": "LiaScript",
  "url": "https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md",
  "version": "22.0.2"
}
```

---

Local course but without `--rdf-url`

```
liaex --format rdf --rdf-preview -i ../LiaBooks/docs/README.md

{
  "@context": "http://schema.org",
  "@type": "Course",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",

  "version": "22.0.2"
}
```

* `--rdf-type`: By default this type of resource is associated with `Course`, but you can use this param if you want to define `EducationalResource` or something else...
* `--rdf-educationalLevel`: This is currently not defined, but can be injected, typically these are beginner, intermediate, advanced, ...
* `--rdf-license`: Use this to specify the URL of the associated license to your course. This tool will automatically check if there is a LICENSE file in your project root and add this.

#### What LiaScript meta-information is used

``` markdown
<!--
author: Your Name
email: author@email.com
comment: Some basic information about your course
version: 12.0.2
logo: https://someimageURL.jpg
tags: keyword 1, keyword 2, keyword 3
language: en
-->

# Title of the course
